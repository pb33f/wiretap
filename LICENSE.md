Princess Beef Heavy Industries, LLC is also referred to as 'pb33f' in this document.

You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided Your use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third
parties on a hosted or embedded basis in order to compete with pb33f’s paid version(s) of the Licensed Work.

For purposes of this license:

A “competitive offering” is a Product that is offered to third parties on a paid basis, including through paid
support arrangements, that significantly overlaps with the capabilities of pb33f’s paid version(s) of
the Licensed Work.

If your product is not a competitive offering when you first make it generally available,
it will not become a competitive offering later due to pb33f releasing a new version of the Licensed Work
with additional capabilities. In addition, Products that are not provided on a paid basis are not competitive.

“Product” means software that is offered to end users to manage in their own environments or offered as a service on
a hosted basis.

“Embedded” means including the source code or executable code from the Licensed Work in a competitive offering. “Embedded”
also means packaging the competitive offering in such a way that the Licensed Work must be accessed or downloaded
for the competitive offering to operate.

Hosting or using the Licensed Work(s) for internal purposes within an organization is not considered a competitive
offering. pb33f considers your organization to include all of your affiliates under common control.

Contact sales@pb33f.io if you have questions about whether your use of the Licensed Work is a competitive offering.
or if you are interested in licensing the Licensed Work for use in a competitive offering.
